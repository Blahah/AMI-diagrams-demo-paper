## **Reconstructing objects**
Many segmented objects are suitable for domain-specific interpretation. 
 1.  Chemical structures are lines and characters, with occasional circles; we often approach 100% Recall/Precison for vector or good pixel diagrams. 
 2.  Phylogenetic trees are often tractable, consisting of a single connected trees with labels close to the tip. We can process rooted trees (orthogonal and circular) and unrooted and for simple diagrams precision is often 100%
 3.  X-y plots. These are often very tractable - again with high precision; they contain
  a. X- and / or Y- axes each consisting of lines with tick marks, scales, quantities and units
  b. symbols or points, perhaps with error bars and legands for each type
  c. an overall title
