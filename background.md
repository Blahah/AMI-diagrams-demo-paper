## **Background**
Over 1 million scientific articles are published yearly and a similar amount of theses and grey literature. Many contain diagrams, such as graphs or domains-specifc objects, representing factual information and often this is the primary way of communication (e.g. molecular structure diagrams). Almost all the diagrams are now born digital (i.e. the output is written directly from a program to file). The programs include generic plotting packages (GNUPlot, R, Excel), specialist editors such as JChempaint or Chemdraw for molecules, or are generated directly from instruments(e.g. spectra). The plots are usually high resolution, either scalable vectors + text (such as SVG or Postscript derivatives) or large pixel maps, often between 1 million and 20 million megapixels. 

Most scientific data is never published (estimates are often > 80% loss), so extraction of data from images can be a vital source of semantic data. Traditional approaches include pencil and ruler, or cutting out peaks and weighing the paper and these are still, infrotuantely, used today.
