A.) A photograph of a chemical molecule on a poster taken with a mobile phone camera. This shows varying backgrounds, line broadening and skewing. In spite of this it is automatically and accurately converted to a semantic molecule with formula C18 H18 N3 O in under a second.

B.) Ths circular tree is separated from its characters and correctly converted to the semantic Newick representation (image from DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036933, figure 1).

C.) This X-Y plot is correctly decomposed into X and Y coordinates of data points and size of the corresponding error bars (image from DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0095565, figure 2). It is possible to create a CSV file directly from this.
