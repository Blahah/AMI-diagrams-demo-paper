## **Current status**
AMI is open source (under the Apache 2 license) and written in pure Java. It can be deployed as a command-line option including recursion over directories and ingestion of web streams. It ingests PDF, SVG, XML, HTML and image formats and usually takes < 1 second per image (some documents include tens of such). It has a plugin architecture using the Visitor pattern so that domain experts can create their own image analysers without having to also write the more basic tools described here. We are actively seeking collaborators.
